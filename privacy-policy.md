# Privacy Policy for Same Origin Method Execution - Targeting Tool

Effective Date: September 26, 2024 (originally created in 2017)

## Introduction
This privacy policy outlines how the Same Origin Method Execution - Targeting Tool extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects user information.

## Information We Collect
The Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data. It only accesses information necessary for its functionality on the active tab when requested by the user.

## Use of Scripting Permission
The Same Origin Method Execution - Targeting Tool extension utilizes the `scripting` permission to execute JavaScript code on specific web pages that the user interacts with. This functionality allows the extension to create alphanumeric references based on the selected elements in the DOM and nothing more.

### How It Works:
- When the user selects an element and activates the context menu item, the extension injects a script into the current page to generate a reference. 
- The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All operations are performed locally within the user's browser.

## Use of Data
The Extension uses the active tab information solely to generate alphanumeric references for selected DOM elements.

## Source Code
The source code for this Extension is available on GitHub: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BenHayak/SOME_Targeting_Tool)

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
